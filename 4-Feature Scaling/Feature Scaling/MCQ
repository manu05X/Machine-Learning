Q>
In which class of Machine Learning problems output should be scaled along with the input features?
Options
    Classification problems
    Regression problems
    Both of these
 >  None of these 
Correct Answer
Solution Description
Explanation: In the classification problem, output variables are discrete so there is no need to normalize it. In the regression problem, scaling the output does not have any effect on the shape of the function. So, only input features should be scaled and not the output variable.

Q>
What should be the output of the following (in terms of zero or non-zero):

   1 import numpy as np
   2 from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
   3 data = [[0,3],[9,4],[2,7],[1,1]]
   4 scaler = StandardScaler()
   5 scaler.fit(data)
   6 first = scaler.transform(data)
   7 second = scaler.transform([[12,13], [1,4], [10,7], [1,9]])
   8 print(first.sum())
   9 print(second.sum())
   
   Options
  > 8th line: zero, 9th line: non-zero 
    8th line: non-zero, 9th line: non-zero
    8th line: non-zero, 9th line: zero
    8th line: zero, 9th line: zero
